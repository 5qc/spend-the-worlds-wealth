                    If Earth's wealth randomly got cashed in and sent to you, you would
                    have a wealth of approximately $5,000,000,000,000,000 (5 quadrillion)!
                </p>

                    This is a simple website to simulate what you could purchase with 5
                    quadrillion, because that's a lot of money.
